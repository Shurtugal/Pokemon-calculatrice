Welcome to this project. As you might have understood by its name, this project has goal to create a Pokemon game, with Python3.
Now, it's just a project, so even if we have the whole 120-pokemon Pokedex, their sprites, the map, and other stuffs, the actual python program is nearly empty.
But if motivation is with us, it will progress !
We've now turned on to pygame (from pyglet), and it's so much better ! More updates soon !

Shurtugal : original idea (on TI-82 calculator !) and code
Dashcom : Psychologic helper
Superkraken : Designer
